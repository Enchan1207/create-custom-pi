# rpi-buildroot

Let's incorporate Raspberry Pi into your project's CI/CD loop!

## Overview

rpi-buildroot is GitHub Actions action for building Raspberry Pi image.

The backend uses [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/), so you can use its caching system.
Combined with [Github Actions caching](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows), you can reduce build times to up to **about half an hour**!

About basic usage and examples, see [wiki](https://github.com/Enchan1207/rpi-buildroot/wiki) pages.

## Contents

This repository provides:

 - **Buildroot base image**: The minimum Docker image for Buildroot to work. It's published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/enchan1207/buildroot_base/general).
 - **GitHub Actions action**: The custom action for inclusion and use in other repositories.

~~External toolchain and legal information is included in release.~~  
**UPDATED: Distribute of external toolchain stopped because it's hard for users to confirm whether legal information (generated by `make legal-info`; command  of Buildroot) is valid.**
